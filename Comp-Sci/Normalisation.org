* Database Normalisation
The process of organizing data in a relational database to reduce redunancy and improve data integrity.

** 1NF normalisation
To achieve the first level of data normalisation a table must adhere to the following rule:
  - All attribute names must be unique.
  - No data is unnecessarily duplicated.
  - Each entity needs a primary key.
  - Each attribute should hold a single value.


** 2NF Normalisation
To have a database in 2NF these rules must be followed:
  - Already be in 1NF
  - Contains no partial dependencies.
A partial dependency is when attributes dont depend fully on a primary key and instead part of it as a compisite.
