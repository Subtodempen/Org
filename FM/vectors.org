* Direction Vectors
 
$r = O + tD$  Is the general equation of a ray. If you want to know if a point belongs on a line you can substitute it as $r$ and find the appropiate value of $t$.
So lets assume, $\vec{O} = (2, 1, 1) \text{ and } \vec{D} = (1, 1, 1)$ and we want to know if the point $\vec{r} = (3, 2, 2)$ lies on the line. First we substite
our value of $r$ to get: $(3, 2, 2) = (2, 1, 1) + t(1, 1, 1)$, $t = 1$ so our point lies on the line.

** Simplifying Direction Vectors
The magnitude of a direction vector doesnt matter only the direction does, so they are typically represented as unit vectors to keep our values of $t$ clean.

** Parametric Form
By letting $r = (x, y ,z)$ we can create three seperate equations: $(x, y, z) = (a_1, a_2, a_3) + t(b_1, b_2, b_3)$ to give use three similatenous equations like so:
$r_n = a_n + tb_n$
